# Bounce

An experiment with p5.js and Tone.js to try and generate random noises that sound good based on environmental collisions. This app creates a container with balls that bounce around and each element (ball, ceiling, walls, floor) gets assigned a subset of notes in a user selected scale. When a collision happens it will randomly select a note from the collision elements + a random note in the current scale to construct and play a chord.
